### IotaWatt 4.8

This is forked from [boblemaire's github](https://github.com/boblemaire/IoTaWatt)

Changes to main repository:
* Changed the PCB to fit a ESP32 (In case one day) and to get the silk screen to show in the generated gurbers
* Created a sample config to integrate with HomeAssistant. This integration uses the rest sensor in HA and queryâ€™s the JSON data every few seconds. You are able to get all your channels as well as any output calculated values you have setup.

NOTE: The PCB s using a 1v refrence shunt so you need to edit the config.txt to add a refvolts item under the device.
